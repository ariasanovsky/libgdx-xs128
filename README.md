# libgdx-xs128

A minimalist replication of `RandomXS128` from the Java library [libgdx](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).

## Features

- Generates pseudo-random numbers using a 128-bit Xorshift algorithm.
- (if requested): Implement the `RngCore` and `SeedableRng` traits from the `rand_core` crate for compatibility with other Rust crates that use the same trait.
